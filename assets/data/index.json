This new approach can be used when you have a supervised neural model that is already reliably performant. It allows you to leverage unlabeled data to further improve the performance of your supervised model - by letting the model label new examples, which it can then learn from.</p>\n<p><span style=\"display:block;text-align:center\"><img title=\"Model Distillation - from Radosavovic et. al. 2017\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"/images/posts/model_distillation.png\" /></span></p>\n<p>Data Distillation borrows from the student-teacher dynamics of <a href=\"https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/research-guide-model-distillation-techniques-for-deep-learning-4a100801c0eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Model Distillation</a>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An aside: <a href=\"https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/research-guide-model-distillation-techniques-for-deep-learning-4a100801c0eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Model Distillation</a> is a technique where we aim to teach a less computationally expensive ''student'' model to mimic the behavior of a complex (and usually pretty computationally expensive) ''teacher'' model. In many multi-target tasks, this consists of training the output distribution of the student to match the teacher's output distribution. This way, we aren't just teaching it about the relevant target (in the case of classification) - but also about the long-tail, which is where a lot of the value of the ''teacher'' can lie. This long tail can be seen as the most difficult-to-learn information contained within these complex models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of using a pre-trained expert model to teach the student, they pick a more indirect path - in which the student has the exact same architecture as the teacher.</p>\n<p><span style=\"display:block;text-align:center\"><img title=\"Data Distillation - from Radosavovic et. al. 2017\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"/images/posts/data_distillation.png\" /></span>\nData Distillation works as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teacher network is trained using the normal supervised dataset for the desired task.</li>\n<li>New unlabeled data is presented to the now-trained teacher network, which predicts a label for each new sample. The unlabeled data is evaluated multiple times by the teacher - each time with a different transform applied (e.g. in the case of computer vision this could consist of rotating, scaling, and/or cropping an image). </li>\n<li>The set of labels per unlabeled data point are seen as outputs from models in an ensemble network, and they are then aggregated to produce a final label.</li>\n<li>The student network - architecturally identical to the teacher network - is trained from scratch on the union of the supervised dataset and this newly ''self''-labeled dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why does this work?</em></p>\n<p>Since many neural models have achieved very good results on computer-vision tasks, the authors argue that using the same network to augment the data used for training no longer just introduces noise into the dataset, but actually introduces new knowledge.</p>\n<h4 id=\"things-to-note\"><a href=\"#things-to-note\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Things To Note:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The output of the ensemble needs to be a hard label - averaging won't be enough, since it produces a ''soft'' label i.e. a probability vector.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The generation of hard labels requires task and dataset-specific logic. In the case of the COCO tasks used by the authors, they apply <a href=\"https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/11/17/non-maximum-suppression-object-detection-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Non-maximum Suppression</a> in order to merge multiple sets of boxes. They also threshold the boxes - boxes with a probability below this threshold are not considered.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The data needs to be managed when retraining. The student model is trained on a union of labeled and unlabeled data, and the authors apply a fixed sampling ratio between supervised and generated examples at a minibatch level. This is done in order to ensure that the quality supervised data is properly represented in every minibatch. The reported ratio is 6:4 original to teacher-labeled images.\n<span style=\"display:block;text-align:center\"><img title=\"Table 1a results - from Radosavovic et. al. 2017\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"/images/posts/table_1a.png\" /></span></li>\n<li>When the system was tested on a small-scale dataset (Table a), the data-distilled student outperformed the smaller supervised dataset. However, when compared to a ''vanilla'' model trained on a supervised dataset that was the same size as union of the small dataset and the augmented data, it was outperformed by the vanilla model. The authors argue that the performance of a fully-supervised model on the small-scale dataset can be seen as the lower bound on the performance of omni-supervised models, since there is much more unlabeled data available.</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"Radosavovic, I et. al.
